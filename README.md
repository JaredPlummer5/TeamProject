HangMan

### Summary of ideas

Connect 4 is a two-player strategy game where players take turns dropping colored discs into a vertical grid. The objective of the game is to connect four discs of the same color in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, while also preventing the opponent from doing the same.

Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where one player thinks of a word and the other player guesses letters one at a time. The objective of the game is to guess the word correctly before the player runs out of guesses and the hangman is completed.
